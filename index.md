Rob's Coding Adventures

My wife says "You know you're not working any more, right?".  I tell her, this isn't "work coding", this is "fun coding".

This blog tracks the progress of the Open Source projects that I work on:
* [Aem Utils](https://github.com/4PointSolutions/aem-utils) - Various AEM Utilities 
* [FluentForms](https://github.com/4PointSolutions/FluentFormsAPI) - Library for invoking AEM Forms services
* [4Point Hamcrest Matchers](https://github.com/4PointSolutions/4point-hamcrest-matchers) - Library containing [Hamcrest](https://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/) matchers useful for writing tests in AEM-related projects.
* [AEM Package Manager API](https://github.com/4PointSolutions/aem-package-manager-api) - Library for programmatically deploying packages to AEM
