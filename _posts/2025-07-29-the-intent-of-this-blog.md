## The Intent Of This Blog

I recently retired from [4Point Solutions] (https://www.4Point.com). One of the challenges of retirement is keeping your mind active, 
(another is keeping your body active too), so I've decided to continue coding.  I try and do 1-2 hours a day on various open source projects.
My wife says "You know you're not working any more, right?".  I tell her, this isn't "work coding", this is "fun coding".

In truth, this is somewhere in the middle.  There were a number of small projects that I started when I was working that I never got a chance to finish,
so I'm using my retirement time to put some polish on them and to keep them up to date.

I enjoy the challenge of writing code without the headaches of deadlines and timesheets.  It also gives me a chance to learn new things 
(new libraries, new language constructs, etc) which I enjoy.  I also find enjoyment in turning ephemeral ideas into working code.

As I learn new things, I intend to write about them here and as I get things in a working state, I will write about them here as well.

Hopefully, these thoughts will be useful to someone somewhere...
